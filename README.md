# thibaultjanbeyer.com v10
Source files for my next personal site at thibaultjanbeyer.com (Version 10)  
Feel free to look around.

I chose to ignore the dist/ folder (to keep prâ€™s clean). If you want it run:
```
$ gulp clean
$ gulp
```
1. removes any leftover dist folders
2. creates the distribution folder 

*Note: you can find all versions (starting at v1 made in 2002) via http://blog.thibaultjanbeyer.com/portfolio/older-versions-of-my-website/*
