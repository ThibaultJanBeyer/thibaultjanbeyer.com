# thibaultjanbeyer.com v10
Source files for my next personal site at thibaultjanbeyer.com (Version 10)  
Feel free to look around.

I chose to ignore the dist/ folder (to keep pr’s clean). If you want it run:
```
$ gulp clean
$ gulp
```
1. removes any leftover dist folders
2. creates the distribution folder

My local folder structure looks like this:
> dist –– the clean distribution folder
> gulp-tasks –– managing gulp
> originals –– this folder holds all the .psd, .ai and other originals
> src –– the working folder
